# Ahoi Plugin for Vue

A Vue plugin, that is build to request data from [Ahoi Plugin for Kirby CMS](https://github.com/tritrics/ahoi-kirby) easily. Comes together with a bunch of additional features which are helpful for building websites (routing, manipulating meta-data, thumb-generation, language support).

This is pre-release for test purposes. Documentation is coming later.

**The interface is likely to change until final release!**
